# SecureShip API

Backend service used to demonstrate real-world DevOps practices.

## Endpoints

- `/health` — Health check for orchestration systems
- `/info` — Application metadata
- `/simulate-failure` — Simulates random failures
- `/delay` — Simulates slow responses

## DevOps Focus

This application is intentionally simple so that infrastructure, deployment,
scaling, and reliability concerns can be demonstrated clearly.
